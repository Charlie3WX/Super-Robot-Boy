# Super-Robot-Boy
A robot maze mini game using ENVIRO and Elma

By Wenbo Xu 
for EEP P 520 Wi 20 - final project

Goal of the Project
====

The goal of this project is to develop a autonomous robot to navigate through a pre-defined maze, the robot will have ability to move in a straight line, turn right corners when approches corners, and to go back and go optional route if encounters a deadend. The robot will win if reaches the goal object, or die if collide with the pit object. Whole project is coded in C++ based on [enviro](https://github.com/klavinslab/enviro) and [elma](https://github.com/klavinslab/elma) developed by professor Eric Klavins.

The robot perceive and make decisions about how to navigate through the maze based on the sensor values it gets through the 4 sensors attached on it. In addition to the autonomous part, the user can intervene the robot by keyboard and mouse commands including starting and stoping the robot, accelerate and decelerate, teleport the robot, reset the robot or change the direction where the robot is facing slightly.
